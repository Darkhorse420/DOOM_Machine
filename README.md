## Motivation
Doom has been considered one of the most influential titles in the game industry since it popularized the first-person shooter (FPS) genre and pioneered immersive 3D graphics. Even though more than 20 years have passed since Doom’s release, the methods for developing AI bots have not improved significantly in newer FPS productions. In particular, bots have still to “cheat” by accessing game’s internal data such as maps, locations of objects and positions of (player or non-player) characters. In contrast, a human can play FPS games using a computer screen as the only source of information.

## Goal
Given software that provides real-time access to the screen buffer, design agents that can play DOOM under various circumstances.
* Strafe only "target practice"
* Navigating corridors
* Surviving in dangerous terrain
* Single-Player original levels
* Single-Player randomly generated levels
* Multi-Player deathmatch

The final two categories represent competitions held by the IEEE Conferency on Computational Intelligence and Games, and the best-performing bot created by the club will be entered in the 2019 competition.
